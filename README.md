# OCR-Digit-Recognition-System
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-image-classification.git

Install the required dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python DIGIT RECOGNITION.py
Usage
The DIGIT RECOGNITION.py script loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the images, defines a sequential neural network model, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and displays predictions for a subset of test images.

Configuration
You can modify the code to experiment with different configurations:

Adjust the number of epochs for training by modifying epochs in the model.fit function call.
Change the architecture of the model by adding, removing, or modifying layers in the model = keras.models.Sequential([...]) block.
Explore different activation functions or optimizer algorithms by modifying the respective parameters in the model.compile function call.
Results
The code outputs the test accuracy of the trained model and visualizes predictions for a subset of test images. It helps to assess the model's performance and observe its predictions alongside the true labels.
